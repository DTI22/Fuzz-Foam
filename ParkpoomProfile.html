                    <p>Hi! This is my cat--Singha. Singha is a Maine Coon and I adopted him when he was 2 weeks old from a family in New York. In this picture, Singha is enjoying himself in the sink. It is one of his favorite places--perhaps it is because it's cooler in there. <a href="http://topattayagirls.blogspot.com/2011/11/what-does-singha-mean-lion-and-thai.html">Singha</a> means lion in a Thai language. I think Singha got the mane that looks just like a male lion. That's why I gave him that name.</p>
